<!-- WORK -->

  <div id="work_section" class="secondBox row">
    <h2>Work</h2>
    <div id="work-description">
      <h4><b>VIACOM, <i>CONSUMER MARKETING</i></b></h4><br/>
        I work on VH1 and Logo TV initiatives in partnerships, promotions, media strategy, and brand marketing. My day-to-day consists of brainstorming for partnership and promotions, event activations, and other consumer-targeted marketing plans to elevate show premieres.<br/>
        Current projects include: America’s Next Top Model, RuPaul’s Drag Race, Love & Hip Hop, Barely Famous, The Breaks<br/><br/>

      <h4><b>MADEO, <i>DIGITAL COMMUNICATIONS</i></b></h4><br/>
        I assist the MADEO team with all facets of digital communication - from social media, blogging, content management, content strategy, SEO, to email communication. I communicate across our content, design, and development teams to make beautiful websites come to life. Projects range from nonprofits, startups, to established companies.<br/>
        Current projects include: Seeds of Peace, Innocence Project, Mercury, Trillium, Pico Pro<br/><br/>

      <h4><b>AUDIBLE TREATS, <i>MUSIC PR</i></b></h4><br/>
        Audible Treats is a premier entertainment marketing and public relations firm with a stronghold in the hip-hop industry. I work closely with the team to develop and execute our clients’ publicity, promotions, and marketing campaigns. I specialize in writing press releases for our clients, as well as conducting national and local tour press.<br/>
        Audible Treats works with both major and indie artists, including T.I., E-40, Souls of Mischief, RJD2, Trae Tha Truth, and dozens more who consistently make waves in the industry.<br/><br/>

      <h4><b>DEV BOOTCAMP, <i>DIVERSITY</i></b></h4><br/>
        Diversity in the tech industry has much more ground to be explored. At Dev Bootcamp, I worked with a talented team to promote diversity in the tech world. I attended meetups and conferences to seek out partnership opportunities for Dev Bootcamp, while conducting heavy research into best practices for inclusion in an educational space. I also assisted with research in program expansion - Dev Bootcamp opened up their Seattle, Chicago, San Diego, and Austin locations this year.<br/><br/>

      <h4><b>SFJAZZ, <i>EDUCATION</i></b></h4><br/>
        I served as a Teaching Assistant for Youth Art Exchange’s summer Percussion internship program with SFJAZZ, where 12 San Francisco public high school students participated in an intensive study of traditional percussion styles with SFJAZZ master percussionists. As an assistant and mentor, I strived to create awareness of community and issues arising in the city such a gentrification and funding cuts to arts education.<br/>

<!-- ABOUT -->

  <div id="about_section" class="thirdSection row">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p class="about_isabel">
      I have an innate love for great art, things that move me no matter the medium, genre, or time period. I grew up equally obsessed with E-40, Green Day, and Chopin - even my mom couldn’t figure out what my deal was.<br/><br/>

      This enthusiasm turned into a drive for working in a diverse range of industries, from music and entertainment to nonprofit and tech. I’m looking to bridge technology and digital communication with the arts, experimenting with creative ways in which people, companies, and brands engage audiences.<br/><br/>

      Currently, I’m gearing up to graduate from Northeastern University with a B.A. in Communication Studies coming December 2016. In the past year and a half, I’ve gained invaluable experience in digital marketing and strategy, public relations, and branding through working in New York City while completing my studies.<br/><br/>

      Outside of work and school, you can find me at live concerts, playing samba drums, or out at an obscure restaurant in Chinatown eating pork dumplings.<br/>
